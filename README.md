# dataset-screenshots-by-console
Dataset with screenshots of videogames labeled by the console that they are from.

I am not the proprietary of any of the images included in this repository.

I included the small parser that I used to generate the dataset, if you want to run it you will need php cli installed in your machine and run the following command:

`php wikipedia_parser.php`
